# mangtas



 A small service `RESTful-API` that accepts an input  from a body of text, such as that from a book, and
returns the top ten most-used words along with how many times they occur in the text.

## Using the Service

To use RESTful-API,
1. Run the go mod tidy to install the dependencies needed to run the server on your local machine.

2. The app can be started in two ways: typing `make run` or `modd` on the command line.

3. The post-man collection can be viewed in the `Mangtas.postman_collection.json` file.
